Read Article CRUD Generator The CRUD Generator is the fastest way to create a fully functional module in KituKizuri. It guides you through the essential setup steps and produces a working CRUD that you can immediately extend using code. Step 1 — Generate the Module Every CRUD in KituKizuri starts with a module. The module defines the unique route identifier, registers permissions, and connects the CRUD to the system's role and company model. Instead of creating each required piece manually, KituKizuri provides a guided Artisan assistant that handles the entire setup process for you. Run the generator bash php artisan krud:make --module What this step does Registers the module with a unique route identifier Creates the default permissions (create, read, edit, delete) Prepares routing using Laravel resource conventions Generates a Controller that extends Krud Creates a Model skeleton ready for customization Once this step is completed, the module exists in the system and can be assigned to roles and companies. Step 2 — Write the Controller Code After generating the module, the next natural step is to define how the CRUD behaves. This is done directly inside the generated Controller. The Controller must extend Krud to access all available CRUD features. From here, you bind the model and define how fields are displayed and handled. Example Controller php use App\\Models\\Product; use KituKizuri\\Krud\\Krud; class ProductController extends Krud { public function __construct() { $this->setModel(new Product); $this->setField(['name' => 'Name of field', 'field' => 'name of column in table' ]); } } What happens here The model defines the data source Fields control form inputs and table columns Configuration replaces repetitive boilerplate code At this point, the CRUD is already usable and fully integrated with permissions and modules. Step 3 — Explore Available CRUD Features KituKizuri provides an extensive set of configuration methods to control validation, visibility, relations, permissions, hooks, and lifecycle behavior.

Docker-based installation (Option A): If you selected the Docker-based setup, this command must be executed inside the PHP container to ensure all dependencies and services are correctly available. Manual installation (Option B): If you selected the manual setup, run this command directly from your local environment. bash Copy php artisan krud:install During this step, an interactive installation wizard will be executed to guide you through the required configuration. For a detailed explanation of each option, see Krud Configuration Wizard. 5. Step 4 — UI Configuration As the final step, configure the visual styles of the application by running the UI configuration command bash Copy php artisan krud:ui-config This command guides you through the setup of the visual appearance of the application, allowing you to define the base styling and UI preferences used across the project. Once this step is completed, the initial installation of KituKizuri is finished and the application is ready for further development. Default Administrator Account After the installation is completed, a default administrator account is created to allow initial access to the platform. Username: admin Password: temp,123 Important: These credentials are intended for initial access only. It is strongly recommended to change the default password immediately after logging in. This administrator account provides full access to the system and can be used to configure users, roles, permissions, and initial application settings. Installation Completed At this point, KituKizuri has been successfully installed and configured. You can now log in using the administrator account, review the initial configuration, and begin building your application.","articleContent":"1.

Read Article Krud Configuration Wizard Multi-tenant Configuration At the beginning of the wizard, KituKizuri asks whether the application should be configured as a multi-tenant system. Yes — Enables multi-tenant behavior and prepares the project to isolate data and configuration per tenant. No — Keeps the application as a standard single-tenant setup, using a single shared configuration. This decision defines how KituKizuri will generate the initial structure and runtime configuration for the project. If you are building a platform where multiple organizations, clients, or environments must operate independently within the same application, enabling multi-tenancy is recommended. You can proceed with the wizard after selecting the option that matches your project requirements. LDAP Authentication In this step, the wizard asks whether the application should enable authentication via LDAP. Yes — Enables LDAP-based authentication, allowing users to log in using credentials managed by an external directory service such as Active Directory. No — Uses the default authentication mechanism provided by the application. When LDAP authentication is enabled, KituKizuri prepares the necessary configuration to integrate the application with an LDAP directory, making it suitable for corporate and enterprise environments where centralized identity management is required. This option is completely optional and can be skipped if LDAP integration is not needed for the project. Vue Integration In this step, the wizard asks whether Vue should be configured as part of the application frontend. Yes — Enables Vue integration and prepares the project structure to support reactive user interfaces and frontend components. No — Keeps the application using a server-rendered approach without additional frontend framework setup. When enabled, KituKizuri configures the necessary assets and dependencies to allow seamless use of Vue within the Laravel project, without forcing architectural decisions. This option is ideal for projects that require dynamic or interactive user interfaces. You can proceed with or skip this integration based on the frontend needs of your application. React Integration In this step, the wizard asks whether React should be configured as part of the application frontend. Yes — Enables React integration and prepares the project to support component-based frontend development. No — Skips React setup and keeps the existing frontend configuration unchanged. KituKizuri allows Vue and React to coexist within the same project if both options are enabled. While this level of flexibility is supported, using multiple frontend frameworks in a single application is generally not recommended unless there is a clear architectural reason to do so. This option is provided to support advanced or transitional use cases where multiple frontend technologies are required. MongoDB Integration In this step, the wizard asks whether MongoDB support should be enabled for the application. Yes — Installs and configures the required packages to allow MongoDB to be used alongside Laravel, including support for working with MongoDB using Eloquent-style models. No — Skips MongoDB integration and keeps the application configured for relational databases only. When enabled, KituKizuri prepares the project to work with MongoDB as a complementary data store, making it suitable for hybrid data scenarios where both relational and document-based models are required. This step focuses on application-level integration, not database provisioning. Database Logging In this step, the wizard asks whether application logs should be stored in the database. Yes — Enables database-backed logging, allowing application events and errors to be persisted for auditing, troubleshooting, and historical analysis. No — Uses the default logging configuration without database storage. When enabled, KituKizuri configures the necessary components to record logs in the database, making them accessible for administrative review and operational monitoring. This option is particularly useful for environments where centralized log visibility or long-term traceability is required.","articleContent":"Krud Configuration Wizard Multi-tenant Configuration At the beginning of the wizard, KituKizuri asks whether the application should be configured as a multi-tenant system.

The name “Kitu Kizuri” comes from Swahili and means “something beautiful.” We chose this name because our goal is to provide a tool that enables fast and practical application development, turning the programming experience into something enjoyable. Read Article Introduction Kitu Kizuri is a starter kit designed specifically for Laravel, created to speed up the initialization of new projects without compromising quality, security, or best practices. Instead of starting from a bare Laravel installation and manually configuring critical aspects of the environment, Kitu Kizuri provides a ready-to-use foundation from day one. The kit integrates key components of the Laravel ecosystem, preconfigured and structured according to official recommendations and widely accepted community practices. This results in a solid architectural baseline, clear conventions, and an initial setup that supports scalability and long-term maintainability. At a high level, Kitu Kizuri acts as a preparation layer: it automates repetitive setup tasks, reduces unnecessary early-stage decisions, and establishes a consistent starting point across projects. This allows development teams to focus quickly on business logic and feature development rather than spending time on preliminary configuration. In essence, Kitu Kizuri turns the Laravel project bootstrap process into a faster, safer, and more predictable experience, providing confidence that the application is built on a robust and reliable foundation from the very beginning. Components Unlike an empty base project, KituKizuri provides a well-defined initial architecture aligned with current industry practices (IAM, Backoffice, DevEx, and Observability), while always preserving Laravel’s flexibility to extend or replace any component according to the project’s needs. The tool is organized into independent components, each with a clear responsibility within the application. This structure makes it easier to understand, adopt by other developers, and evolve over time. Krud IAM (Identity & Access Management) Krud IAM is the component responsible for identity, authentication, and authorization management within the application. Its primary goal is to provide a strong security foundation from the very beginning of the project, significantly reducing the time and risk associated with implementing these mechanisms manually. This component is internally composed of: Native integration with Laravel Jetstream, providing authentication, session management, and user profiles. Centralized user management, allowing administrators to create, update, and manage users. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), organized by application modules. Optional integration with Active Directory through LDAP, ideal for corporate and enterprise environments. Krud IAM enables teams to start projects with security standards aligned to modern best practices, without sacrificing the flexibility to extend or customize access rules. Krud Backoffice (Admin & CRUD Management) Krud Backoffice provides a centralized administrative interface that simplifies the operation and maintenance of the application. It is designed to accelerate day-to-day system management while minimizing repetitive development for administrative tasks. This component includes: A graphical interface to manage Krud IAM, simplifying user, role, and permission administration. A low-code catalog (CRUD) generator, enabling fast creation and maintenance of entities. Tools for integrated MySQL database management. Optional database-level log storage, focused on traceability and operational support. Krud Backoffice transforms technical maintenance tasks into simple, visual processes, allowing teams to focus on business logic instead of repetitive infrastructure work. Krud Platform (Developer Experience & Integrations) Krud Platform is designed to enhance the Developer Experience (DevEx) and ensure consistent environments from day one. Its purpose is to eliminate common technical friction points when starting or scaling a Laravel project. This component includes: A Docker-based development environment, highly recommended to ensure portability and consistency. Optional integration with Vue, enabling the development of modern, reactive user interfaces. Optional integration with MongoDB, supporting hybrid data scenarios Krud Platform allows teams to adapt the technical architecture of the project without imposing rigid decisions, supporting the natural growth of the application. Krud Ops (Observability & Operations) Krud Ops focuses on the operation, monitoring, and traceability of the application throughout its lifecycle. It is designed to provide operational visibility and simplify maintenance in production environments. This component includes: Optional database-backed logging. Support for auditing and tracking key system events. A foundation prepared for extending into metrics, monitoring, and alerting. Krud Ops provides the necessary tools to operate the application with confidence, detect issues early, and maintain full control over system behavior.","articleContent":"Introduction Kitu Kizuri is a starter kit designed specifically for Laravel, created to speed up the initialization of new projects without compromising quality, security, or best practices.
